Sed  is  a  stream  editor.   A stream editor is used to perform basic text transformations on an input stream (a file or
        input from a pipeline).  While in some ways similar to an editor which permits scripted edits (such as ed), sed works  by
making  only one pass over the input(s), and is consequently more efficient.  But it is sed's ability to filter text in a
pipeline Which particularly distinguishes it from other types of editors.
