# Benefits {#concept_nlv_kt4_tdb .concept}

## Superior  performance {#section_ank_xt4_tdb .section}

-   The Cluster Features support ultra-large capacity and ultra-high performance. This service supports cluster functions and cluster instances of 128 GB or higher to meet large capacity and high performance requirements.
-   The master-slave dual-node architecture provides up to 64 GB instance, to meet the capacity and performance requirements of average users.

## Elastic scaling {#section_jh3_yt4_tdb .section}

-   Storage Capacity one-click capacity expansion: the user can adjust the instance storage capacity through the console according to the business needs.
-   Online resizing with no service interruption: You can adjust the instance capacity online without suspending your services or affecting your business.

## Data Security {#section_e3s_yt4_tdb .section}

-   Persistent data storage: With memory + hard disk storage, the feature provides high-speed data read/write capability and meets the data persistence requirements.
-   Master-slave dual-backup for data: All data is backed up both on master and slave nodes.
-   Password authentication is supported to ensure secure and reliable access.

## High availability {#section_r1y_154_tdb .section}

-   Dual-copy and cluster version instances have a master node and a slave node. This prevents service interruption caused by SPOF.
-   Automatic detection and recovery of hardware failure can automatically detect hardware failures and fail over to the slave node, restoring service in a matter of seconds.
-   Instance-level resource isolation provides enhanced stability for individual services.

## Second-level monitoring {#section_m2b_c54_tdb .section}

-   Supports real-time second-level monitoring, and minute-level historical monitoring.
-   Provides monitoring information for data structures and interfaces, allowing you to monitor access conditions at a glance. This helps you fully understand the usage of ApsaraDB for Redis.
